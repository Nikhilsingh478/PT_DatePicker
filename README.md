## Key Components & Logic

### State Management
- **Zustand** (`src/store/useRecurrenceStore.js`):
  - Holds all recurrence settings (type, interval, weekdays, custom patterns, date range, preview dates).
  - Provides setters and toggles for all user actions.

### Recurrence Logic
- **`getRecurringDates`** (`src/utils/recurrence.js`):
  - Calculates all dates matching the current recurrence settings.
  - Handles daily, weekly, monthly (nth weekday), and yearly patterns.
  - Uses local time for date formatting to avoid timezone bugs.

### Main UI (`src/app/page.js`)
- **RecurrenceSelector:** Choose between daily, weekly, monthly, yearly.
- **DateRangePicker:** Select start and end dates.
- **CustomRecurrenceOptions:** Set interval (e.g., every 2 weeks).
- **WeekdaySelector:** Pick weekdays (for weekly recurrence).
- **MonthlyPatternSelector:** Pick nth weekday (for monthly/yearly).
- **CalendarPreview:** See all generated dates live.

### Testing
- **Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Test Example:** `src/components/MonthlyPatternSelector.test.jsx`
  - Renders for monthly/yearly, updates store on change, checks accessibility.
- **Config:** `vitest.config.js` sets up the `@` alias and jsdom environment.
