# Recurring Date Picker

This is a simple web app I made to help pick recurring dates, like for events that happen every week, month, or year. I made this to learn React and Next.js!

## What it does
- Lets you pick a start and end date
- Choose how often something repeats (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- For weekly, you can pick which days
- For monthly/yearly, you can pick patterns like "second Monday"
- Shows a preview of all the dates that match your settings

## How to run it
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (I used version 18, but newer should work)
2. Download or clone this project
3. Open a terminal in the project folder
4. Run this to install the stuff it needs:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the app with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Tech used
- [Next.js] - (React framework)
- [Zustand] for state
- [date-fns] for date stuff
- Tailwind CSS for styles
